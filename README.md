In this era of digital and interconnected world, the capable of understanding and responding to the human emotions has become increasingly significant for the community to creating or developing technologies that more empathetic and responsive. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is one of the tasks that can recognize the emotional aspects of speech from humans, irrespective of the actual semantic contents. Even though this activity can be easily performed by most human, even at an early age as a natural aspect of speech communication, research regarding to the capability of automatically recognizing it using computer software is still currently underway. Based on research by E. André, M. Rehm, W. Minker, and D. Bühler, it has been established that one of the most important ways to make machines behave more like humans is to give them emotions. By harnessing the power of machine learning and real-time processing, we aspire to create a technological leap that enhances our digital interactions, making them not only more efficient but also more emotionally attuned to the needs and sentiments of users.
